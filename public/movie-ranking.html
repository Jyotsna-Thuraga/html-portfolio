        <hr>
        <h3>Hi Nanna!</h3>
        <p> This is one of the all time awesome movies. I loved the way Nani acted. One of his best films so far</p>
        <h3> Shyam Singha Roy</h3>
        <p> This is another film of nani's that I love. Especially the second half.</p>
        <h3>Khaleja</h3>
        <p> This is Mahesh Babu's film that is the perfect combination of comedy and action. I would definitely recommend this one too.</p>
